# @digdir/designsystemet-react

React implementation of the Designsystemet components

- Headless components.
  - Uses `@digdir/designsystemet-theme` and `@digdir/designsystemet-css` for styling.
- All components support `forwardRef`.
- Most components extend and behave as native html-elements.
- Most components support composition and `asChild` for overriding the underlying html-element.
- SSR support.
